## I am a Junior Software testing Engineer looking for new career opportunities in the testing industry. I have experience in mobile testing (Startups), and as part of the training courses I have experience in testing a web site. I am a person who does not stand still, always develops and quickly adapts to new conditions. I want to work in a friendly team that sees its goals and goes to it.
